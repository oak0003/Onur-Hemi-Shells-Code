# Onur-Hemi-Shells-Code
Includes code that allows for optical property prediction for a composite surface of hemispherical shells and an opaque substrate. Done for Onur Kucuktas Master's Thesis at GATECH, 2022

RunningForPlotsV6.m   : This script runs the main algorithm CubicCellHemiArrayProp.m and allows for changing of parameters

RunningForPlotsV3.m   : This script runs the algorithm for a single beam CubicCellHemiArrayPropSingleBeam.m and was used for beam visualization
